## Hi there 👋

I am a Developer/Designer from India.
"About Me” is the most cliched tab of all the websites of this world. Yet, here I am to pump up my self-esteem and to appear at least like a human. So, stalk me with all your curiosity; you have my chuckled permission!
What's all this hullabaloo for "About Me"?Let me spill the beans:

They call me Aashi. I am studying engineering but my heart always throbbed for literature, art, design and every other thing that makes life worth living.

Books are my lifelines. Movies are my oxygen. I am not an “artist” so to say but I adore every form of art. Yes, even the attempt made by a toddler with crayons. I do have my fair share of opinions but I do not impose them. Because my music could be your chaos and vice versa.

- 👨🏼‍💻 I mostly do Frontend development & Design.
